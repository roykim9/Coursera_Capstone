While there are many different aspects in defining a neighborhood, this project focuses on the ethnicity of the neighborhood. For example, what are the main businesses in Chinatown? How about in Little Italy? This information will be valualble to those who are starting a new business. Before deciding on where to open a business, it is important to understand where the demand is for a specific business type.\n\nThis project will study this relationship between the distribution of the ethnic restaurants and the business categories in the Bay Area, California, US."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Data\nFirst, a list of neigborhoood data is downloaded from the [dataSF webpage](https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Bay-Area-ZIP-Codes/u5j3-svi6). This data contains the name of the neighborhood by the zip code in the Bay Area.\n\nSecond, each nighborhood with a zip code will be assigned the latitude and longitude coordinate. The dataSF does provide information on the coordinate, but in the format of a multipolygon which is not useful in this project.

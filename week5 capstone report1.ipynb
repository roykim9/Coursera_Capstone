While there are many different aspects in defining a neighborhood, this project focuses on the ethnicity of the neighborhood. For example, what are the main businesses in Chinatown? How about in Little Italy? This information will be valualble to those who are starting a new business. Before deciding on where to open a business, it is important to understand where the demand is for a specific business type.\n\nThis project studied this relationship between the distribution of the ethnic restaurants and the business categories in the Bay Area, California, US."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Data\nTwo main data sets are used for this project. One is the information on the location of the neighborhoods in the Bay Area, and the other is the information of the business in each neighborhoods. Three different sources of information is used as described below.\n\nFirst, a list of neigborhoood data is downloaded from the [dataSF webpage](https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Bay-Area-ZIP-Codes/u5j3-svi6). This data contains the name of the neighborhood by the zip code in the Bay Area.\n\nSecond, each nighborhood with a zip code will be assigned the latitude and longitude coordinate. The dataSF does provide information on the coordinate, but in the format of a multipolygon which is not useful in this project. So the coordinate data is downloaded from the [OpenDataSoft webpage](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/us-zip-code-latitude-and-longitude/export/?dataChart=eyJxdWVyaWVzIjpbeyJjb25maWciOnsiZGF0YXNldCI6InVzLXppcC1jb2RlLWxhdGl0dWRlLWFuZC1sb25naXR1ZGUiLCJvcHRpb25zIjp7fX0sImNoYXJ0cyI6W3siYWxpZ25Nb250aCI6dHJ1ZSwidHlwZSI6ImNvbHVtbiIsImZ1bmMiOiJBVkciLCJ5QXhpcyI6ImxvbmdpdHVkZSIsInNjaWVudGlmaWNEaXNwbGF5Ijp0cnVlLCJjb2xvciI6IiNGRjUxNUEifV0sInhBeGlzIjoic3RhdGUiLCJtYXhwb2ludHMiOjUwLCJzb3J0IjoiIn1dLCJ0aW1lc2NhbGUiOiIiLCJkaXNwbGF5TGVnZW5kIjp0cnVlLCJhbGlnbk1vbnRoIjp0cnVlfQ%3D%3D). This data contains all the coordinates throughout the US, so only thoses for the Bay Area are used.\n\nThird, the ethnic restaurant data and the other business category data is downloaded from [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/places-api/). And the data is processed to show the popular ethnic restuarants and the relevant business categories."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Methodology section\n\nThis section describes how the data is collected, processed, and presented. Each subsection is numbered with a subtitle."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### 1. Import a list of zipcodes in the Bay Area\n\nThe neighborhood and the zipcode data is imported in csv file type that was downloaded from [dataSF webpage](https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Bay-Area-ZIP-Codes/u5j3-svi6). The csv file is then converted into a dataframe for the ease of process in python. Unnessary columns are removed from the dataframe with only the zip code and the name of the city."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### 2. Import a list of latitude and longitude data associated with zipcodes in US\n\nThe latitude and the longitude data is downloaded from the [OpenDataSoft webpage](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/us-zip-code-latitude-and-longitude/export/?dataChart=eyJxdWVyaWVzIjpbeyJjb25maWciOnsiZGF0YXNldCI6InVzLXppcC1jb2RlLWxhdGl0dWRlLWFuZC1sb25naXR1ZGUiLCJvcHRpb25zIjp7fX0sImNoYXJ0cyI6W3siYWxpZ25Nb250aCI6dHJ1ZSwidHlwZSI6ImNvbHVtbiIsImZ1bmMiOiJBVkciLCJ5QXhpcyI6ImxvbmdpdHVkZSIsInNjaWVudGlmaWNEaXNwbGF5Ijp0cnVlLCJjb2xvciI6IiNGRjUxNUEifV0sInhBeGlzIjoic3RhdGUiLCJtYXhwb2ludHMiOjUwLCJzb3J0IjoiIn1dLCJ0aW1lc2NhbGUiOiIiLCJkaXNwbGF5TGVnZW5kIjp0cnVlLCJhbGlnbk1vbnRoIjp0cnVlfQ%3D%3D).

Merge the two dataframes to create a new dataframe that includes zip code, city, latitude, and longitude\n\nTwo dataframes from the previous steps are merged into one new dataframe. Again some of the columns that are not relevant in this project are removed and the final dataframe is saved with four columns: zip code, city, latitude, and longitude."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### 4.

Explore venues of the first zipcode area\n\nThe [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/places-api/) data is extracted to explore the venues in the neighborhood of Belmont, 94002.

One hundred venues were retrieved in this neighborhood and put into a dataframe as shown below."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### 6. Explore all the nighborhoods in the Bay Area\n\nThis section expands on the previous section to explore all the neighborhoods in the Bay Area. A function is defined to retrieve up to one hundred venues in each zip code area with their names, locations, and categories. The results show how many venues were retrieved from each zip code area in a dataframe. A total of 355 unique venue categories are identified in the Bay Area.\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### 7. Analyze each neihborhood\n\nThe frequency of business categories are measured from each neighborhood to understand what kind of business is popular. Among all the different business categories, the restaurant categories are seperated out. A series of restaurant categories is created to show all the venue categories that include the word 'restaurant'. And with this series, a new dataframe is created to have only the restaurant businesses. Among the restaurants, the most popular restaurants in the Bay Area are Mexican and Chinese. The final dataframe shows how the restaurants are distributed among different neighborhoods."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### 8. Cluster neighbors by the restaurants\n\nIn order to locate similar neighborhoods based on the restaurant presence, the k-means clustering is used. The k value is set to 10 for this project and all the neighborhoods are clustered using the restaurant data. To later evaluate the similarities between the neighborhoods, a dataframe is created with the top ten most popular restaurants in each neighborhood that includes the cluster label, latitude, and longitude data."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### 9. Map the clustering result\nThe clustered neighborhoods are shown in different colors on the map. The first thing to notice is that there are lot of the red circles throughout the whole area representing the cluster 0. In the downtown area of the San Francisco and the Berkeley region, yellow circles, which are cluster 7 are dominantly present. The skyblue circles, representing cluster 4, are found around the residential regions in San Francisco, Daly City, and Hayward."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### 10. Examine each clusters\n\nFour clusters are selectively evaluated to check which restaurants are dominant.\nCluster 0: Vietnamese, Jewish, and Japanese Curry standout among other restaurants\nCluster 4: Chinese, and Mexican are popular\nCluster 7: Vietnamese, Italian, and Japanese\nCluster 9: Indian\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Results section\n\nThroughout the whole Bay Area, many neighborhoods have Vietnamese and Jewish restaurants as their most popular restaurants (red circle). And in the downtown areas of San Francisco and Berkeley, Vietnamese, Italian, and Japanese are popular (yellow circle). In residential areas such as Sunset, Palo Alto, Daly City, South San Francisco, and Hayward, Chinese and Mexican restaurants are shown to be popolar (skyblue circle). \n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Discussion section\n\nRegardless of the neighborhood location, Vietnamese and Jewish restaurants has broad presence. So for a new business owner for Vietnamese and Jewish restaurants, the location in where they select is not very critical. Although further study is necessary to confirm any direct correlation between the two ethinic restuarants, the results shown here suggest there maybe some relationship between them.\n\nIt is also interesting to see the contrast between the downtown and the residential area. In the downtown of San Francisco and Berkeley, Vietnames, Italian, and Japanese are shown to be popular. It is possible that these ethinic restaurants are more popular for business meals, or a place to grab quick lunch for the workers. On the other hand, residential areas such as Sunset, Palo Alto, Daly City, South San Francisco, and Hayward, Chinese and Mexican restaurants are shown to be popular. \n\nFor a new business, following these trends of the majority of the each ethnic restaurants would be the safe place to start. Chinese restaurants being more popular in the residential area than the downtown area is telling that there is more demand in the residential area. And if the location of the new business is fixed in one neighborhood, opening a Vietnamese or a Jewish restaurant would be a better choice as they are popular throughout the whole region. "}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Conclusion\n\nDistribution of the ethnic restaurants in the Bay Area is studied in this project and the results show that there are specific ethnic restaurants that are popular throughout the region and there are also restaurants popular specific to the neighborhoods. This result will provide a baseline on where there are more demand for each ethnic restaurants for those who want to start a new business in restaurants."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
